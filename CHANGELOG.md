<p>- Revision 1(pre Alpha): had user enabled placement of star systems and was using image layers as reference. Also rudimentary implementation of note textbox postboned to later releases. Storing data was a major issue without using server side components.</p>
<p>- Revision 2(pre Alpha): had fx added for star systems: plasma, corona, glow. Dropped fx due to continous issues with saving data. Using server side components is no option, but outsourcing data to Github to reference in the file is. This keeps file size relatively small.</p>
<p>- Revision 3(pre Alpha): current version. Dev mode to create star systems during run time. Pre placed star systems placed. Outsourced all possible data to Github. This will render local storage enough, but make internet connection a necessity.</p>
<p>- Alpha 1(19.10.2023): static star icons, custom text box, local storage for text, star background anim, system anim, label toggle, testing phase ended, system iframe</p>
<p>- Alpha 2(20.10.2023): 
  - add real time watch
  - outsourced no longer needed mouse coordinates and fs toggle 
  - add general and hotkey description page div...no content...sorry, real life obligations
  - fixed non passive wheel scroll block
  - fixed default browser key block not working
  - outsourced prevent default function to .js, to enable use in all files<br>
Hotfix 1: reimplemented mouse coordinates. le douche forgot he was using it to define the text box</br></p>
