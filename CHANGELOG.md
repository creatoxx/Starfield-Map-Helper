<p>- Revision 1(pre Alpha): had user enabled placement of star systems and was using image layers as reference. Also rudimentary implementation of note textbox postboned to later releases. Storing data was a major issue without using server side components.</p>
<p>- Revision 2(pre Alpha): had fx added for star systems: plasma, corona, glow. Dropped fx due to continous issues with saving data. Using server side components is no option, but outsourcing data to Github to reference in the file is. This keeps file size relatively small.</p>
