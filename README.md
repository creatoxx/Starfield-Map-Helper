# Starfield-Map-Helper
A small project for Starfield to provide missing features of the ingame map...

7.12.2023: We're lcosing in to release date. I will supposedly not manage to import all 120 systems, because it not only akes a long time to build, but also it's a literal pita to do so. I will provide about 25-30 systems with initial release, and bit by bit add more systems during the next year, after initial release. You can help if you'd like to. Take one of the system.html as template, and adapt to the given data. You do not need to be perfect when doing this. If you just provide the basic changes, and apply the correct links etc., 95% of the work is already done. I might provide a complete self replicating template at one point.
